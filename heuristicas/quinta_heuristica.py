'''
Population initialization issues: The initialize_population function may not be correctly generating a sufficient 
number of valid placements. In particular, the check for overlapping rectangles might not correctly prevent placing 
rectangles in the same spot, leading to infinite loops in some cases.

Subdivision and Relocation: In the relocation function, you are subdividing the population but never returning 
the subdivision correctly into a form that will be processed in later steps. The subdivision should be recombined 
into an actual population list that can be passed forward.

Crossover Issues: When doing a crossover, it seems you might want to maintain a list of rectangles in their 
flattened form, but you are keeping them in the "quadrant" structure. You need to ensure that the crossover 
recombines the rectangles into a valid list (the dissolved list).

Randomness: There's an issue with how you're using the random.random(0,1) function. The random.random() 
function does not take parameters; it generates a float between 0 and 1. So you should just call random.random() 
without arguments.

Fitness Calculation Overlap Penalty: You should check whether the fitness function is correctly calculating 
overlaps between the rectangles. If the overlaps are not being penalized correctly, it can lead to invalid 
solutions being selected as the best ones.

Final Plot: When plotting, ensure that the rectangle list is correctly passed to the 
plot_polygon_and_rectangles function, especially after subdivision and relocation.
